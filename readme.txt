!It works only on linux-based systems!

running from the console gives an oppotunity to use some flags and parametres:

"-r"          to run general files in default text editor (can change in variable EDITOR)
"-h"/"--help" to get readme
"/PATH/"      to change directory where tree will appear
"EDITOR"      to set custom text editor for opening (default = Sublime Text)
